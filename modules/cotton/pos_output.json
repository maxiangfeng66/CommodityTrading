Managed money has been net short for 39 consecutive weeks - a record streak.

The 22.7% COT strength score is well below the 25% threshold that typically marks contrarian buy zones. Commercial hedgers net long suggests smart money views current prices as undervalued. The unwinding from record shorts indicates speculative capitulation may be underway.

Non-commercial net short of -27,431 contracts and managed money at -50,372 net short place the market at the 22.7th percentile - firmly in contrarian buy territory. The record 39-week consecutive short streak and October 2025 peak of 80,000+ shorts represent historic extremes. Short-covering of +1,489 contracts weekly and post-holiday rally suggest the turn is beginning. Commercial hedgers net long at 75.7% strength score confirms producer view that prices are undervalued.
