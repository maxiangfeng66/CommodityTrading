    "supply_outlook": "Global cotton supply remains abundant with production at 119.4 million bales, the highest in 5 years. Brazil has emerged as the world's largest exporter with record production of 17.0 million bales and record exports of 2.83 million tonnes. China's production surged 9.7% with Xinjiang contributing 92.3% at exceptional quality levels. US production rebounded 19% to 14.4 million bales. These gains more than offset declines in India (15-year low) and Pakistan (flood-damaged crop). The supply overhang is expected to persist into 2025/26.",
    "demand_outlook": "Global mill consumption is modestly growing at 1-1.7% annually, forecast at 118 million bales for 2025/26 - the highest since 2020/21. However, consumption growth lags production growth, widening the surplus. Key demand drivers include expanding textile industries in Vietnam and Bangladesh. China's consumption faces headwinds from US tariffs impacting textile exports. Cotton continues losing market share to synthetic fibers, with cotton's global textile share below 25% versus 50%+ in the 1970s.",
