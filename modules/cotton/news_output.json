        "point_1": "The bullish thesis relies heavily on US supply tightening, but this ignores the global context. Global production (119M bales) still exceeds mill use, and ending stocks are rising globally. How can US-specific tightness support prices when substitution from Brazil/Australia is readily available?",
        "point_2": "Export sales 'rebounding' in one week is insufficient evidence of sustained demand. Year-to-date export commitments remain 15% below last year. One strong week does not establish a trend.",

        "point_2_rebuttal": "Agreed. The export data is mixed. I am adjusting weight given to this factor. The rebound shows demand exists but consistency is lacking.",
        "point_3_rebuttal": "Partially valid. The sentiment improvement (79% positive/neutral in AmCham survey) represents directional change even if structural barriers persist. The Phase Two deal framework provides a pathway for further reductions.",
