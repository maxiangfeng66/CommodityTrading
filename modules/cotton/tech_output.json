    "trend_assessment": "ICE Cotton No.2 is in a prolonged consolidation phase within a well-defined rectangle pattern (61.29-69.54). Price is trading above short-term MAs (5, 20, 50-day) but remains firmly below longer-term MAs (100, 200-day), indicating bearish structural bias. The ADX at 12.56 confirms absence of trending conditions.",
    "momentum": "RSI readings in the 43-47 range suggest neutral momentum with slight bearish undertone. Stochastic indicators approaching oversold territory (30.29 %K) hint at potential near-term bounce. However, the lack of bullish divergence limits upside conviction.",

          "Challenge 2: Stochastic at 30.29 is approaching oversold. Combined with price at lower third of 52-week range, doesn't this suggest asymmetric risk/reward favoring upside?",

        "response_to_challenge_1": "Valid point on MA count. However, weighting longer-term MAs more heavily reflects their greater significance in establishing primary trend direction. The 200-day MA at 67.56 represents a 4.5% premium to current price - a substantial hurdle. Short-term bullish alignment is necessary but insufficient for trend reversal.",
        "response_to_challenge_2": "Acknowledged. The stochastic approaching oversold (30.29) does create bounce potential. However, oversold can become more oversold in downtrends. The lack of bullish RSI divergence limits confidence in a sustained reversal. I'll adjust to recognize this asymmetry.",
        "response_to_challenge_3": "Seasonality is a valid consideration. Historical Q1/Q2 strength provides a tailwind. However, this is a technical analysis focused on price action, and seasonal factors are secondary to price structure. I'll incorporate this as an upside risk factor."

The neutral RSI and low ADX prevent a more bearish score. Score maintained at -1 with 'neutral' outlook rather than 'bearish' to reflect mixed signals.",
