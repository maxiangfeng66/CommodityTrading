India's 26% production recovery is overwhelming domestic demand, though export progress is slow. The bearish consensus is firmly established and reflected in speculative positioning (-168k contracts net short). However, the crowded short trade near multi-year price lows suggests limited downside from current levels. Technical support at the 52-week low of 14.04 cents/lb is critical - a break would confirm further downside to 13.80 and potentially 13.00. The risk/reward for fresh shorts is poor given crowding; better to wait for rallies or support breaks. Key catalysts to monitor: Brazil weather developments, India export policy changes, and any demand surprises."
