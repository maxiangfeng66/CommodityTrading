    "executive_summary": "CME Copper Futures present a moderately bullish opportunity with asymmetric risk/reward favoring patient buyers. Supply constraints from mine disruptions (particularly Grasberg) and sluggish production growth (+1.4% in 2026) support structural tightness. Demand drivers from the energy transition, grid infrastructure, and AI/data centers provide a solid floor. However, near-term headwinds exist: China demand fell -8% in Q4 2025, COT positioning is extended at the 83rd percentile with declining net longs, and current price ($5.88/lb) already reflects much of the bullish consensus. The key differentiation among analysts is demand assumptions - JP Morgan sees a 330kt deficit while Goldman sees a 160kt surplus. We favor the mild deficit scenario but acknowledge uncertainty. Recommended approach: maintain moderate bullish exposure, add on pullbacks to $5.50-5.70 support, take profits on approaches to $6.15-6.30, and use $5.00 as a stop-loss level. Monitor COT data for positioning reset (sub-70% strength) as potential re-entry signal."
