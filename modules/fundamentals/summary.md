## Supply Analysis

### Global Production (119.4 million bales)
- **China:** 31.75M bales (+16% YoY) - Highest since 2013/14
- **India:** 25.0M bales (stable)
- **Brazil:** 16.5M bales (near-record yields, +14% of global)
- **United States:** 14.4M bales (+2.3M bales YoY)
- **Pakistan:** 5.2M bales (-19% YoY due to competing crops)

### Supply Outlook: BEARISH
Production surplus of ~3.4 million bales versus consumption. Four of five major producers showing increased/stable output. No supply disruptions anticipated.

---

## Demand Analysis

### Global Mill Use (116.0 million bales)
- **China:** 37.5-38.0M bales (32% of global, under tariff pressure)
- **India:** 25.0M bales (21% of global, stable)
- **Bangladesh:** Growing (+8% imports)
- **Vietnam:** Record 7.4M bales (+12%)

### Demand Outlook: NEUTRAL
- Mill use recovering from 2022/23 contraction
- Emerging market textile sectors providing support
- Synthetic fiber competition (77.6% market share) limits upside
- US-China tariffs creating headwinds

---

## Stocks Position

### Global Ending Stocks: 78.3 million bales
- Highest level in 5 years
- Stocks-to-use ratio at 67.5% (elevated)
- Largest increases in US and Brazil

### US Ending Stocks: 4.4 million bales
- Stocks-to-use ratio at 34%
- Exports at 11.9M bales supporting drawdown
- Still elevated versus historical norms

---

## Key Drivers

1. **Production Surplus** - Global output exceeds consumption by 3+ million bales
2. **Record Stocks** - 5-year high global ending stocks pressuring prices
3. **China Rebound** - 16% production increase adding significant supply
4. **Brazil Strength** - Near-record yields, now second-largest exporter
5. **Weak Demand Growth** - Only 1.3% mill use increase insufficient to absorb surplus

---

## Risk Factors

### Upside Risks (Could Push Prices Higher)
- Weather disruption to 2025/26 crops
- Stronger-than-expected economic growth boosting textile demand
- Chinese government reserve purchases supporting prices
- Mean reversion from 61% decline since May 2022

### Downside Risks (Could Push Prices Lower)
- Further tariff escalation reducing trade flows
- Economic slowdown in key consuming markets
- Continued synthetic fiber substitution
- Currency impacts on export competitiveness

---

## Seasonal Considerations

Historical patterns indicate cotton tends to reach annual highs March-July. The current contango structure (March 2026: 65.35c, July 2026: 66.36c) reflects this expectation. However, with elevated stocks, seasonal rallies may be muted.

---

## Price Outlook

| Timeframe | Direction | Confidence |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Near-term (0-3 months) | Sideways to Lower | High |
| Medium-term (3-6 months) | Potential Seasonal Rally | Medium |
| Long-term (6-12 months) | Dependent on 2025/26 fundamentals | Low |

Current price range of 60-65 cents/lb appears to reflect fundamental reality. Significant upside requires demand acceleration or supply disruption.

---

## Conclusion

Cotton fundamentals for the 2024/25 marketing year are moderately bearish. The market faces a structural surplus with production exceeding consumption, ending stocks at multi-year highs, and limited demand catalysts. While cyclical bottom indicators suggest downside may be limited, upside potential requires a shift in the supply-demand balance that current data does not support.

**Overall Fundamental Score: -2 (Moderately Bearish)**
