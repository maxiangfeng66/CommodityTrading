## Executive Summary

**Overall Sentiment:** Neutral-to-Bullish (+2 on -5 to +5 scale)

ICE Cotton No.2 futures face a moderately supportive news environment heading into late January 2026. The USDA's January report confirmed tighter US supply conditions, while export demand reached marketing-year highs. Government support through the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program provides producer relief. However, record Brazilian exports and elevated global production create headwinds.

**Price Outlook:** 64-70 cents per pound for Q1 2026
